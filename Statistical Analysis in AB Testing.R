####Statistical Analysis in A/B Testing####

###Power Analysis###
##Definitions dive deeper:
#Power: 
#the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's false;
#the basic step of estimating the sample size needed to detect an effect of a particular magnitude; 
#the test with higher power is preferred.

#Significant Level:
#the level of probability at which it is agreed that the null hypothesis will be rejected

#Effect Size: the magnitude of the effect you are expecting
#Difference between control and experiment groups population means of a response variable, divided by assumed common population standard deviation

#Power Analysis Relationships: holding the significant level and effect size constant
